# Applied AI Engineering for the Enterprise

## Capstone Starter

These instructions will guide you through running the container environment locally in a VS Code instance using Docker Desktop. If you instead need/want a GitHub Codespaces environment, see [README-codespaces.md](./README-codespaces.md) in this repository. 

<br><br>
# Steps

**1. First, ensure you have the prerequisites list under the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section installed and running on your system.**

<br><br>

**2. Click on the button below to open the code from this repository as a development container in your local VS Code instance.**

<br>

If this doesn't work for some reason, an alternative approach to opening the code in VS Code is detailed [here](#alternative-approach-to-open-in-vs-code). There is also a [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) you can reference if you run into problems.

**3. This will run for a long time (up to 10 minutes) while it gets everything ready.**

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

![Ready to use](./images/aia-1-1.png?raw=true "Ready to use")

When you see this, just hit *Enter* to get to a prompt.

<br><br>

**4. Open up the *labs.md* file so you can follow along with the labs.**
You can either open it in a separate browser instance or open it in the codespace.

**Now, you are ready for the labs!**

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- At least 4 CPU cores
- 16GB RAM minimum
- 32GB free disk space

### Required Software

#### 1. Install Docker Desktop
- Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Choose the appropriate version:
  - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**: Download "Mac with Apple chip"
  - **Intel Mac**: Download "Mac with Intel chip"
- Install by dragging Docker.app to Applications
- Launch Docker Desktop and complete the setup
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running (you'll see the whale icon in your menu bar)

#### 2. Install Visual Studio Code
- Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Open the downloaded .zip file
- Drag Visual Studio Code to your Applications folder
- Launch VS Code

#### 3. Install Dev Containers Extension
- Open VS Code
- Press `Cmd+Shift+X` to open Extensions
- Search for "Dev Containers" (published by Microsoft)
- Click **Install**

---

## Alternative Approach to open in VS Code

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skilldevai/ae-day2.git
cd ai-aip
```


### 2. Open in VS Code
```bash
code .
```

### 3. Reopen in Container
When VS Code opens, you should see a notification asking if you want to "Reopen in Container":
- Click **Reopen in Container**

If you don't see the notification:
- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette
- Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
- Press Enter

### 4. Wait for Initial Setup
The first time you open the container, it will take **10-15 minutes** to:
- Build the Docker container
- Set up the Python environment
- Install all dependencies
- Install Ollama
- Download required AI models

You can monitor progress in the VS Code terminal.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop Not Running
If you see "Docker is not running" errors:
- Check that Docker Desktop is running (whale icon in menu bar)
- Try restarting Docker Desktop
- Ensure you've completed the Docker Desktop setup wizard

### Container Build Fails
- Ensure you have enough disk space (32GB minimum free)
- Check Docker Desktop has sufficient resources allocated:
  - Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources
  - Ensure at least 4 CPUs and 8GB memory are allocated

### Ollama Models Not Downloaded
If models are missing:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:latest
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### Port Already in Use
If you see port conflict errors:
- Check what's using the port: `lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER`
- Stop the conflicting service or change the port in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
